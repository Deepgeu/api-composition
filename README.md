1-->Creating a summarization API that can generate summaries for both videos and websites is a complex task that involves several components like natural language processing (NLP) for web content, video analysis, and text summarization. Building such an API from scratch would require a comprehensive set of tools and expertise in machine learning and NLP.

Below is a high-level outline of what the code for such an API might look like, using Python and a few common libraries and services. Please note that this is a simplified example, and the actual implementation would be much more involved.

Web Content Summarization (using Python and NLP libraries):
You can use libraries like BeautifulSoup and Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) to scrape and summarize web content.

Video Summarization (using a Video Analysis Service):
For video summarization, you can use specialized video analysis services like IBM Watson or Google Cloud Video Intelligence, or you can use pre-trained models like OpenAI's CLIP for analyzing and summarizing video content. Setting up video analysis from scratch is a complex task.

2-->API Integration:
Create an API endpoint that takes a URL as input, checks if it's a video or a website, and calls the respective summarization function. You can use a framework like Flask or Django to create the API.

3-->Deployment:
Deploy your API on a server or a cloud platform.
Please note that building a robust and production-ready summarization API requires a lot of considerations, including handling various edge cases, error handling, scalability, and security. Additionally, for video summarization, you might need specialized video analysis services and tools.

This example provides a simplified starting point, and you may need to invest a significant amount of time and effort to build a comprehensive summarization API for both videos and websites.
